# ColorShapeConcepts

Code needed for the paper "How Object Concepts are Represented and Decoded by the Brain". Includes:
- Wrangling fMRI and behavioral Data from associated OpenNeuro archive (link)
- Running searchlight cross decoding and other algorithms on this data
- Generating rough versions of all figures in the paper

Much of this code is dependent on the `neurotools` library (github: link), which contains core algorithms and utility functions. 

## Structure:
- analyze
- visualize
- data
- figures
